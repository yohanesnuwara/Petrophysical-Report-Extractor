# Petrophysical-Report-Extractor

Motivation: 

The upstream oil and gas industry often deals with unstructured data such as reports and they want to standardize into structured data and store in their database. As LLM is growing, LLM is capable of extracting data from technical reports and convert to structured data format such as JSON, which can be further converted into Excel, a data format that most enginers are comfortable with. One of such applications is petrophysical reports such as Routine Core Analysis (RCA) and Special Core Analysis (SCAL) data.

Data: 

Public petrophysical report of Poseidon-2 well by ConocoPhillips Australia, is used for this project.
